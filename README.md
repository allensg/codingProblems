A small docker container spun up to give myself a work bench for coding problems.
right now just an echo instance mapping to localhost. 

Different problems are housed in different files in the problems directory for my sanity. 

Breaking each language up into different directories in problems (goProblems, elixirProblems, rubyProblems etc) though the main web app and container is being handled in go. 

~~Right now general rule is if it has a test file it has been solved.~~
Have put testing on pause for a bit for the leetcode150 problemset as it comes with its own test files to process the submissions and determine correctness. though going back and testing these would also be good practice, i don't need them here to prove the program works

Might make this an actual webpage later. maybe something where you select the available solved problems from a list and it lets you customize the input? or something?
