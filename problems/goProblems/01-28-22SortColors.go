// Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the
// same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
// Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
// Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.
// Can you do this in a single pass?

// input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
// output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
