// Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

	// this solution runs faster than 70% of other submitted answers. partly because
	// go is awesome and fast but also becaues of the majority element premise.
	// we don't acutally have to traverse the entire array to get the whole solution we just need to return
	// whatever number passes that number. so theoretically the cime complexity for this is O((n/2)+1) to O(n) depending on the ordering of the array.
	//  its possible we can't tell the majority until the very last element, or exactly 1 more than the middle element
